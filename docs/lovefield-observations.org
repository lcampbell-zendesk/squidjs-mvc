* Having to to ~await schema().connect()~ means you can't write queries as data
** They have to have access to an object that's initialised asyncronously
* Transactions are kind of verbose
** And initially difficult to get working
* Only allowing async queries is a pain and overkill
** Means we can't query the db as part of the render fn
** Instead have to have render triggered by queries
