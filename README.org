* SquidJS MVC
A JS native port of the idea from the ClojureScript Squid framework.
** Todo
*** TODO Figure out a more general data transformation pipeline
**** TODO Is there a way we can set an observer at the schema level rather than query?
**** TODO Can we construct trees of immutable data that match the general view heirarchy?
**** TODO Is it slow to have every query re-run for every change?
*** DONE Bring in TodoMVC static assets
