** No todos
*** DONE When there are no todos, #main and #footer should be hidden.
    CLOSED: [2017-10-06 Fri 11:59]
** New todo
*** DONE New todos are entered in the input at the top of the app.
    CLOSED: [2017-10-06 Fri 10:49]
*** DONE The input element should be focused when the page is loaded, preferably by using the autofocus input attribute.
    CLOSED: [2017-10-06 Fri 10:50]
*** DONE Pressing Enter creates the todo, appends it to the todo list, and clears the input.
    CLOSED: [2017-10-06 Fri 10:50]
*** DONE Make sure to .trim() the input and then check that it's not empty before creating a new todo.
    CLOSED: [2017-10-06 Fri 11:15]
** Mark all as complete
*** TODO This checkbox toggles all the todos to the same state as itself.
*** TODO Make sure to clear the checked state after the "Clear completed" button is clicked.
*** TODO The "Mark all as complete" checkbox should also be updated when single todo items are checked/unchecked.
**** Eg. When all the todos are checked it should also get checked.
** Item
*** DONE Clicking the checkbox marks the todo as complete by updating its completed value and toggling the class completed on its parent <li>
    CLOSED: [2017-10-06 Fri 11:52]
*** TODO Double-clicking the <label> activates editing mode, by toggling the .editing class on its <li>
*** DONE Hovering over the todo shows the remove button (.destroy)
    CLOSED: [2017-10-06 Fri 11:38]
** Editing
*** TODO When editing mode is activated it will hide the other controls and bring forward an input that contains the todo title, which should be focused (.focus()).
*** TODO The edit should be saved on both blur and enter, and the editing class should be removed.
*** TODO Make sure to .trim() the input and then check that it's not empty.
*** TODO If it's empty the todo should instead be destroyed.
*** TODO If escape is pressed during the edit, the edit state should be left and any changes be discarded.
** Counter
*** DONE Displays the number of active todos in a pluralized form.
    CLOSED: [2017-10-06 Fri 11:29]
*** DONE Make sure the number is wrapped by a <strong> tag.
    CLOSED: [2017-10-06 Fri 11:29]
*** DONE Also make sure to pluralize the item word correctly: 0 items, 1 item, 2 items. Example: 2 items left
    CLOSED: [2017-10-06 Fri 11:29]
** Clear completed button
*** DONE Removes completed todos when clicked.
    CLOSED: [2017-10-06 Fri 11:55]
*** DONE Should be hidden when there are no completed todos.
    CLOSED: [2017-09-22 Fri 15:29]
** Persistence
*** DONE Your app should dynamically persist the todos to localStorage.
    CLOSED: [2017-10-06 Fri 11:19]
*** DONE If the framework has capabilities for persisting data (e.g. *** Backbone.sync), use that.
    CLOSED: [2017-10-06 Fri 11:19]
**** Otherwise, use vanilla localStorage.
*** DONE If possible, use the keys id, title, completed for each item.
    CLOSED: [2017-10-06 Fri 11:19]
*** DONE Make sure to use this format for the localStorage name: todos-[framework].
    CLOSED: [2017-10-06 Fri 11:19]
*** TODO Editing mode should not be persisted.
** Routing
*** TODO Routing is required for all implementations.
*** TODO If supported by the framework, use its built-in capabilities.
**** Otherwise, use the Flatiron Director routing library located in the /assets folder.
*** TODO The following routes should be implemented:
**** TODO #/ (all - default)
**** TODO #/active
**** TODO #/completed (#!/ is also allowed).
*** TODO When the route changes, the todo list should be filtered on a model level and the selected class on the filter links should be toggled.
*** TODO When an item is updated while in a filtered state, it should be updated accordingly.
**** E.g. if the filter is Active and the item is checked, it should be hidden.
*** TODO Make sure the active filter is persisted on reload.
