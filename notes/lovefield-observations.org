* Having to to ~await schema().connect()~ means you can't write queries as data
** They have to have access to an object that's initialised asyncronously
* Transactions are kind of verbose
** And initially difficult to get working
* Only allowing async queries is a pain and overkill
** Means we can't query the db as part of the render fn
** Instead have to have render triggered by queries
* Tables aren't a good way of storing individual elements
** Could end up building an EAV representation on top
** Having a 'new' todo kind of works
*** Though there are attributes of it that it never really makes use of
** But no equivilent for the select all button
* Quick user input can cause concurrency issues
** Typing loses events as they're over-written
